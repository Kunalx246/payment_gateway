        Giving is not just about making a donation,<br> it's about<br> making a difference.
      </h2>

      <p>
        There are people who don’t donate because they assume everyone else is, and there are those who take up the torch and run with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        At TSF, we believe that all students deserve to be engaged in their educational journey and inspired to succeed. We also recognize the critical correlation between educational engagement and future achievement. Research shows us that many students in the middle grades struggle to see the connection between what they are learning in school and their future – often creating a disconnect and lack of interest in their education.
      </p> 

      <p>
        That’s why TSF is committed to creating opportunities specifically designed for students in the middle grades – opportunities that forge the gap between what they are learning in the classroom and what they dream to accomplish later in life. We recognize the middle school years as a critical time of development for exploration, inspiration, and learning to help students stay connected to and fuel their dreams.
      </p>

      <p>
        We’ve got a lot of work ahead of us, and your donation can make it much easier to get things done and thrust us forward. With each donation we receive, we become all that much closer to our goal.

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <img class="w-img" src="images/img2.jfif" alt="">
      <p>The TSF engages communities to provide career exploration and self-discovery opportunities that help middle school students understand, experience and pursue what’s possible.<p>
        <p>Through a combination of transformative workshops and one-on-one mentorships, the TSF is engaging students to think about what’s possible for their futures in new and exciting ways.<p>
        <p>Our program expands growing minds and equips students with the skills necessary to turn their dreams into reality. We believe in the power of partnerships and helping aspirations come to life through access to inspirational role models and environments.</p>
